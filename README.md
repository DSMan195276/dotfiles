DSMan195276's Dotfiles
======================

A combo of all my various configuration files (Like everybody else's dotfiles repo)

(Currently using an i3 setup)

A lot of the stuff here is somewhat random/specefic to my exact setup, you're better off stealing stuff then copying completely. And that being said, I tend to jump between stuff a lot so some of the config's here may either be broken or a bit stale.

One of the intents of my configuration setup is to make everything fairly unified in how it's controlled, and as I use vim a lot the keybindings are very much shaped around vim keybindings. Also with that, I swap my caps-lock and left-control key to make control easier to press, so because of that I map lots of stuff onto control when I can.

The Window manager, whichever one you go with (The xinitrc has lots and lots of options) will/should have most or all of it's keybindings all mapped to the Windows/super key. The main i3 setup differs from this slightly, since for convience I mapped two of the modes to Control+; and Control+'.

For more specefic info on each config file it's worth just taking a look and seeing what all I've done.
